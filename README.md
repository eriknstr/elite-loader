# Elite Dangerous Inspired Loader

This repository was constructed based upon source files from:

  * The original pure CSS codepen by James Panther available at
    http://codepen.io/jpanter/pen/PWWQXK/, released under the
    MIT license according to
    http://codepen.io/jpanter/details/PWWQXK/#details-tab-license.

  * The SVG + CSS forked codepen by Rob Speed available at
    https://codepen.io/robspeed/pen/LxWGGe/, released under the
    MIT license according to
    https://codepen.io/robspeed/details/LxWGGe/#details-tab-license.

The authors of each of these codepens were not involved in the creation
of this git repository but I have provided their names as authors to git
since they wrote the contents, and meanwhile I am listed as committer.
This is an accurate way to commit code by others IMO and I hope that
others see it this way too.
